Hi! My name is Alan Ochoa, and I'm currently studying computer science at UIC as a third-year undergraduate student. I work on many personal projects that involve creating useful programs that help me with day-to-day tasks. I also love to code fun games. Coding, for me, is fun when I can challenge myself and think up new ways to solve a problem. Solving those problems is such a great feeling. I've been coding for years, since my first year of high school, where I took many coding classes. In my free time, I find myself gaming and reading. So reach out if you're also interested in video games and books. I am seeking to learn more efficient coding techniques, so also reach out if you find new ways to improve my projects!

Languages I can code in:
- C/C++
- Java
- Kotlin
- HTML / CSS / Javascript
