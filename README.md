Hi! My name is Alan Ochoa and I'm currently studying Computer Science at UIC as a third year undergraduate student. I work on many personal projects that involve creating useful programs that help me on day to day tasks. I also love to code fun games. Coding, for me, is fun when I can challenge myself and think up new ways to solve a problem. Solving those problems is such a great feeling. I've been coding for years, since my first year of high school where I took many coding classes. In my free time I find myself gaming and reading, so reach out if your also interested in video games and books.

Languages I can code in:
- C/C++
- Java
- Kotlin
- HTML / CSS / Javascript
